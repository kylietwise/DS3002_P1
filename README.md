DS3002P1.csv = Final exported csv

For this project I used the instagram API to gather basic user information about my roommates and me. Once I got this information I added a column based on how many posts each person was sharing and then converted the data into a dataframe. Finally, I exported the dataframe as a CSV to my disk. 


Ultimately my exported data had 8 records, one for each of my roommates and me. As well as 5 columns, for username, followers, following, posts, and share_score. Share_score was a variable I created that ranks us from 1-8. 8 is the highest share_score and indicates the person who posts the most whereas 1 (or tied 2 in this case) represents the people who post the least.
